# LiveRail

## Overview

Provides users with real-time data on the status and conditions of London's underground services.

## Description

LiveRail is a simple, straightforward, vite-powered React application that utilizes the Tfl's (Transport for London) API to provide real-time data on London's underground trains.

### *A Note from the Developer*

> Over the past year, I have taught myself how to code. I have learned and continue to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. To further hone my skills, I've worked on numerous mini-projects. However, this is my first fully-fledged React project, and I'm excited to share it with the Creative Computing Institute at UAL. While I'm aware there is still much room for improvement within this project, I wanted to showcase my coding capabilities thus far to the Admissions team at CCI while acknowledging that my technical capabilities in this new industry have much room for improvement. I believe CCI can significantly help me enhance my technical skills in this industry, which I have found myself so deeply interested in. I hope you enjoy the project.

- A dropdown menu will appear, and a user can select the intended line.
- Once a line is selected, a pop-up menu appears displaying the line name, its status, and the reason for any possible delays in service
- The pop-up menu's background colour will also change depending on the quality of service:
    - Good Service = Green

    - Severe Delays = Red
- Once a line name is removed from the search bar, the pop-up menu disappears.
